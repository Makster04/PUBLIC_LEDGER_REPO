## Index designs

### Flip-Flop Index 🩴
**Measures:** reversals over time in what they actually did.

- **Record switches (100%, required):** of the issues where they have recorded actions at least 2 years apart, the share where later actions took the opposite side from earlier ones. Recorded actions are votes, bills and official acts. For a president, that means signings, vetoes and executive orders.
- **Changed-position checks:** shown beside the index, not counted in it. They already count at half credit in the promise score.

**Minimum:** 5 issues with 2 or more actions each.

**Example:** 10 issues with actions at least 2 years apart, and on 3 of them later actions took the other side. That gives 3 ÷ 10 = **30**.

**Keys and sources:**
- **Recorded actions and how they're coded by issue:** the reviewed research. No key.
- **Newer votes:** Senate and House roll calls (no key), and `CONGRESS_API_KEY` for bills and House votes from 2023 on.
- **State legislators:** `OPENSTATES_API_KEY` and `LEGISCAN_API_KEY`.
- **A president's executive orders:** the Federal Register. No key.

### Pants on Fire Index 🔥
**Measures:** the average falseness of their fact-checked claims from the last 6 years.

- **Scoring each rating:** True 0, Mostly True 20, Half True 50, Mostly False 80, False 100, Pants on Fire 100.

**Minimum:** 10 ratings.

**Example:** 10 ratings: 2 Mostly True, 3 Half True, 3 Mostly False and 2 False. That gives (2×20 + 3×50 + 3×80 + 2×100) ÷ 10 = **63**.

**Keys and sources:** 
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, through Google's Fact Check Tools. It covers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and other fact-checkers.

### New Promises Delivered grade formula 📦
**Promises Delivered** = Promise score − Flip-Flop deduction − Pants on Fire deduction. It never goes below 0.

- **Promise score:** today's score, unchanged: (kept + ½ × partly kept or changed) ÷ counted checks. For a president, it's PolitiFact's promise trackers instead.
- **Flip-Flop deduction:** Flip-Flop Index × 0.10. At most 10 points.
- **Pants on Fire deduction:** (Pants on Fire Index − 50) × 0.20, only when the index is above 50. At most 10 points. Fact-checkers mostly pick claims that already sound doubtful, so only a mostly-false record costs points.
- The grade still needs today's minimum of 3 counted checks. The indexes adjust a grade but can't create one.
- An index showing "Not enough data" deducts nothing.
- Together the two indexes can take off at most 20 points, the same as trading on the Ethics grade.

**Example:** promise score 80, Flip-Flop Index 30 and Pants on Fire Index 63 give 80 − (30 × 0.10) − ((63 − 50) × 0.20) = 80 − 3 − 2.6 = **74.4, rounded to 74 (C)**.

**Option:** to keep Pants on Fire out of the grade, delete its deduction line and add "The Pants on Fire 🔥 index sits beside the grade, not inside it." The formula then becomes Promise score − Flip-Flop deduction.
