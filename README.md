# Public Ledger

A local, automatically refreshed scorecard of 2026 Senate and House candidates, with a Cloudflare Worker and D1 configuration for later hosting. It grades each person on four measures (Your match, Promises delivered, Ethics and Workers > Profit) from reviewed research, shows a Money & Influence Analysis beside the grades, and refreshes official records from every free source that can run alongside the others.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or later. On a Mac (or Linux), open Terminal in this folder, run `npm ci` the first time, then `npm start`, and visit **http://127.0.0.1:8787**. On Windows, open **Start Public Ledger.cmd** instead; it installs dependencies if needed. Python 3 is needed only for the by-hand import scripts listed under "Not refreshed automatically".

The local server binds only to your computer. It uses `.local/records.sqlite` and checks the refresh queue once a minute while running, fetching up to 40 source pages each time (`LOCAL_STEPS` in `.dev.vars`). Each source gets only its own share of those, set under its published or reported rate limit (`perRun` in `src/sources.mjs`), and a job that has started fetching pages finishes before new ones start. The hosted worker fetches 8 pages per run. Closing it stops the checks; saved data survives restarts. Nothing has been deployed or subscribed to.

## Enable automatic updates

1. Get the free keys below. Each key unlocks only its own sources, and the app runs without any of them.
2. Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` in this directory. Every key in the example is blank.
3. Enter each key after its name. Keep this file private; Git ignores it.
4. Restart the local server. Open **API updates** to see which keys are set and each API's progress, and **Website updates** for the official websites read directly.

No key is needed for the Senate and House roll calls, the Senate and House committee lists, the House Clerk's disclosure index, members' press-release feeds, the Federal Register, Bluesky posts, the Wayback Machine, GDELT news, DOJ press releases, ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer, FARA or USAspending. Every key that is set is used at the same time. Sources whose key is missing wait on the Updates screen as "Setup needed", and the app shows the reviewed research. The Updates screen distinguishes setup requirements, queued work, successful refreshes, and retrying failures. The button runs the next eight source pages; a large source can require several batches. Frontend keys are never used, and saved request links never include a key.

## What refreshes

**Money**

- **Campaign totals:** FEC principal committee summaries, on their own reporting dates.
- **Donors by employer:** FEC itemized individual contributions (over $200) totaled by the donor's employer, then month by month for the top 20 employers, for the top-20 donor tracking. Retired, self-employed and similar entries are left out. Donors' names are never kept or shown, as FEC rules on reusing contributor data require.
- **Campaign committee:** for a candidate whose principal committee is not configured, the FEC candidate-committee lookup, rechecked weekly.
- **PAC contributions:** processed FEC Form 3, Schedule A line 11C, in the selected two-year period. Memo entries are excluded. These contributions are part of campaign receipts.
- **Outside spending:** processed Schedule E with `most_recent=true`. Only general-election entries directly naming the candidate, with dissemination dates within the window, enter the current totals. Support and opposition are separate; opposition to another candidate is not credited to this person. Negative corrections remain. Exact repeated transactions are deduplicated; different transaction IDs remain distinct. Primary/special/unspecified elections, memo entries, future dates and missing dates are separately counted as exclusions.
- **Groups behind outside spending:** for the ten largest spenders in each race, their own filings from ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer when the spender is a nonprofit with exactly that name. Anything else (super PACs, 527 groups, several possible matches) is listed for review with a link to the IRS's 527 filings search; the IRS publishes 527 data only as a bulk download.
- **Lobbying:** LDA.gov filings for each of the top 20 donor organizations this year, with the bills each report names. Foreign-agent registrations (FARA) are matched to the top donor organizations by name.
- **Federal contracts:** USAspending contracts to the top donor organizations, matched by the company's federal ID (UEI) from SAM.gov. Only a single exact name match is used; anything else is left for review.
- **Stock trades:** read straight from the members' own trade reports, with no key. For House members, each periodic transaction report listed in the House Clerk's yearly disclosure index (this year and last) is downloaded and its text read (`src/pdf.mjs`); for senators, the Senate eFD site is searched and each electronic report's table read. A report filed on paper is a scanned image, so it is listed under "Reports to check by hand" with its link. Reports already read are not downloaded again. The three trade services (Bargo for the last 3 months, Eulerpool and Financial Modeling Prep) run alongside as a cross-check: the same trade from more than one place is merged into one row (same member, company, date, buy or sell, and amount range), the official report's date, description and link win, and a trade only a service reports is flagged for review. Each company's industry code comes from SEC EDGAR for the committee-conflict rule. Both sites' reports fall under the Ethics in Government Act, which bars using them for any commercial purpose other than news media, for credit ratings, or to solicit money; the Senate site asks every visitor to agree to that, and the reader agrees each session.
- **Comments on federal rules:** Regulations.gov comments by the top donor organizations, as context for the Money & Influence Analysis.

**Record**

- **Legislation:** current-Congress bills and resolutions each member sponsored or cosponsored, from Congress.gov, with official links. Recently updated earlier-Congress bills are excluded. The interface shows up to 100 of each; raw published records are retained.
- **Bill details:** for each key bill (the bills behind the selected votes and the bills marked People or Profit, listed as `keyBills` in `data/config.json`), its Congress.gov title, latest action, CBO cost estimates, committee reports, latest summary and amendments.
- **CRS reports:** Congressional Research Service reports from the last 60 days, each matched to the bills it covers, shown on the profiles of people who sponsored or cosponsored them.
- **Official acts:** Federal Register documents (executive orders, rules) for profiled people who held federal executive office, set with `federalRegister` on the person in `data/config.json` (set for Donald Trump, `{"president":"donald-trump"}`).
- **Votes:** the original 50 selected roll calls, the latest 30 Senate roll calls discovered from the official index, and new House roll calls. House votes from 2023 on come from Congress.gov's House vote endpoint when the Congress.gov key is set, and otherwise (and for votes it does not cover yet) from the House Clerk's files. This is not a complete historical voting archive. House positions use Bioguide IDs; Senate positions use LIS IDs from congress-legislators. An unmatched person produces no inferred vote.
- **State legislative records:** bills, votes and sponsorships for profiled people who serve or served in a state legislature, from Open States (daily) and LegiScan (weekly) together, merged by state, session year and bill number. Each person is found by name in their state; when more than one person matches, the job stops and asks for the ID (`openstates` or `legiscan` on the person in `data/config.json`). Disagreements are listed for review against the legislature's own record.
- **Committee assignments:** the official Senate and House member lists, compared with the reviewed committee list and flagged where they differ.

**Statements**

- **Floor speeches:** the Congressional Record from GovInfo. Each new daily issue is read once, speech by speech, and matched to members by Bioguide ID.
- **Hearings:** GovInfo hearing transcripts that list a profiled member, and committee meetings of the members' committees from Congress.gov's committee-meeting endpoint, with witnesses, witness testimony and committee documents (the House Document Repository's files, served through Congress.gov). Meetings are rechecked weekly as documents are added.
- **Videos:** new uploads on each official's YouTube channel (from congress-legislators), read from the channel's uploads list at 1 quota unit a request.
- **Issue positions:** Vote Smart interest-group ratings and the Political Courage Test, one person at a time, only with a paid Vote Smart license (off while the key is blank).
- **Press releases:** each sitting member's press releases, from the RSS or Atom feed on their official website. The job uses the feed the homepage advertises, then the feed congress-legislators lists, then the usual Senate and House feed addresses. They often carry the same message as the office's posts on X and Facebook, which have no free API.
- **Bluesky posts:** each person's official and campaign website domains are checked as Bluesky handles (only a domain's owner can use one), plus any accounts in `data/config.json` (`social.bluesky`). Run `npm run social:bluesky` on your computer to find more: it keeps only accounts linked from the person's official or campaign website, or carrying Bluesky's verified badge with their name, and `-- --write` saves them.
- **Threads posts:** each person's Threads account (`social.threads`, or else their Instagram username, which a Threads profile always uses) is searched for each issue's keyword, so only posts that mention an issue are collected. Needs `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- **Campaign websites:** every distinct Wayback Machine capture of each candidate's campaign site since the cycle began, so a promise can be compared with earlier versions after it is edited or deleted.
- **Fact-checks:** published fact-checks of each politician's claims, from Google's Fact Check Tools, as leads for statement checks.
- **News coverage:** articles naming each politician, from GDELT and the New York Times together, merged by link, as leads for statements and ethics cases.

**Ethics leads**

- **Court records:** CourtListener dockets and opinions naming profiled people (exact full-name search), checked weekly to stay within the free account's daily limit.
- **FEC enforcement:** enforcement cases (MURs), administrative fines, alternative dispute resolutions and advisory opinions naming the person, their campaign committee, or a committee named after them.
- **DOJ press releases:** releases whose title names the person's surname and whose text names them in full.

**Nothing new changes a grade by itself.** New votes, bills, speeches, posts, positions, fact-checks, news, court and enforcement records, trades and filings are listed for review; a grade changes only when the reviewed research is updated and the monthly recalculation runs. An ethics lead becomes a scored case only after its status is confirmed from an official record.

With every senator included there are about 3,300 checks, so the first full pass takes a few hours on the local server. When people who vote are added, the Senate or House roll calls already read are read once more so their positions are filled in. Each source is scheduled again 24 hours after completion (7 days for court records, FEC enforcement records, LegiScan, FARA, committee meetings and the campaign-committee lookup), except individual roll calls and Congressional Record issues: a published vote or Record issue is final and is not fetched again. Jobs that depend on another (the lobbying, rule-comment, company-ID and monthly-donor jobs wait for a person's top donor organizations; contracts wait for company IDs; nonprofit filings wait for the outside spenders) start as soon as it finishes. All pages must succeed before new records publish. Full replacements pick up revised totals, amendments and removed records instead of appending forever. Failed runs leave the last published snapshot intact and retry with backoff; source `Retry-After` is respected, and a rate limit pauses every job on that host. A database lock prevents overlapping refreshers. The UI provides on-page failure/staleness notices and a refresh history; external email or push alerts are not configured. An existing database gains the jobs for new sources the next time the server starts.

Some snapshots can have different check and coverage dates. In particular, checking the FEC today does not create a newer campaign filing. Imported comparisons stay labeled as research snapshots; refreshed records appear separately, under **Latest official records** at the bottom of each profile's tabs, so different reporting windows are not silently mixed:

- **Money & Influence:** campaign totals, PAC contributions, outside spending and the nonprofits behind it, top donor organizations, lobbying, foreign-agent registrations, comments on federal rules, company IDs and federal contracts
- **Your match:** sponsored and cosponsored bills, CRS reports, official acts, state legislative records, official committee lists and roll calls
- **Promises Delivered:** floor speeches, hearings, committee meetings and testimony, press releases, Vote Smart positions and ratings, Bluesky and Threads posts, videos, campaign-site snapshots, fact-checks and news
- **Ethics:** stock trades (with the filing-delay and sector charts), the official House disclosure filings, court records, FEC enforcement records and DOJ press releases

**Not refreshed automatically.** These are imported once and rebuilt by hand, so they change only when someone reruns them:

- **Voteview DW-NOMINATE scores**, with the rest of the reviewed research in `public/research.json` (biographies, race ratings, ethics, statement checks, issue coding).
- **Member IDs and committees**, from [congress-legislators](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators), by `node scripts/build-ids.mjs` (no key). It adds each profiled person's LIS, Vote Smart, Wikidata, Ballotpedia and other IDs, official social accounts and campaign site to `data/config.json`, refreshes `keyBills`, and writes `public/committees.json`. Candidates who never served are looked up in Wikidata by their FEC candidate ID when Wikidata is reachable. Run it after a new Congress or a committee change, after checking the differences the Updates screen and profiles flag.
- **Every senator**, from congress-legislators, by `npm run senate:build` (`node scripts/build-senate.mjs`, no key). It writes `public/senate.json`, the list behind the Senate page and the senators' home cards, and adds each senator without a reviewed profile to `data/config.json` (marked `basic: true`) so the refresh collects their records, then fills in everyone's IDs and committees the same way `build-ids.mjs` does. Rerun it when a senator joins or leaves, then build the new senators' portraits (see Portraits); a senator who leaves stays in `data/config.json` until removed by hand.
- **Portraits**, from [unitedstates/images](https://github.com/unitedstates/images), supplied photos and freely licensed Wikimedia Commons photos (license and credit checked for each), built by `scripts/build-portraits.py` (see Portraits).
- **Funder timelines**, from FEC bulk files, built by `scripts/build-funder-history.mjs` (see Money and votes over time).
- **Yearly financial disclosures, blind trusts and older trades**, from the House Clerk's and Senate's disclosure sites, read with the CapitolGains Python package by `scripts/build-holdings.py` into `data/holdings-review.json` for review. Senate transaction reports are parsed into trades; House reports are PDFs and are listed with their links. A reviewer copies each confirmed trade into the person's `trades` in `public/research.json`. Senate eFD has no API and asks visitors to agree to its terms on use of the reports, so senators are included only with `--accept-senate-terms`.
- **Not imported yet:** executive-branch disclosures from the Office of Government Ethics (no API) and state campaign finance.

## Bundled snapshot

`data/seed.json`, when present, holds published snapshots from a completed refresh, so a new install shows campaign, PAC, outside-spending, legislation and vote data immediately instead of waiting hours, and works without API keys. **None has been committed yet**, so a new install currently starts empty and fills as the refresh runs. The file is loaded only when `.local/records.sqlite` is new; an existing database is never overwritten. Seeded records keep their original check dates, so with API keys an old seed refreshes in the background on the normal schedule. A seed made for a different cycle, Congress or session is ignored.

To update it, let the local server finish its refresh (every job on **API updates** and **Website updates** has completed at least once), then run `npm run seed:export` and commit `data/seed.json`. The export stops if any job has not completed yet (`npm run seed:export -- --partial` exports what has), and refuses to write a file containing any API key from `.dev.vars` or a link carrying a key.

## Scoring rules

The full rules, formulas and worked examples are in [Scores/00_POLITICAL_SCORECARD_METHODOLOGY.md](Scores/00_POLITICAL_SCORECARD_METHODOLOGY.md), and the Methodology page in the app states the same rules. Every weight, threshold and deduction lives in one place, `public/grades.js`, so changing a value there changes every page; `public/scoring.js` applies the rules to each person, for the page and the monthly recalculation alike; and `npm test` checks each rule.

**Rule 1: actions count more than words.** Sponsoring or cosponsoring a bill, voting on it, and an official act (for officials who don't vote in Congress) each weigh 1.0. A floor speech or public statement weighs 0.5 and is used only on an issue with no recorded action; once a vote, sponsorship or official act exists, it replaces earlier statements. Sponsoring a bill and then voting on it counts once (the vote is the one counted). Every bill has one ID, such as `117-hr-1319`, so a vote and a sponsorship can be matched. A Yea or a sponsorship takes the bill's marked side and a Nay the other; missed votes are not counted; if someone says one thing and votes the other way, only the vote is scored. A person who never held federal office but held a state office is scored on that state record, with the same weights.

| Grade | What it measures | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Your match** | How closely the record matches the positions the visitor chose, weighted by the importance they gave each issue. Issues with no evidence are left out; statement-only issues count at half importance | 3 issues with evidence, covering half of the visitor's total importance |
| **Promises delivered** | Whether what they committed to matches what they did: supported 1, partly supported or changed position ½, contradicted 0. Ambiguous and outcome checks, promises with no related bill yet and vague goals are left out. A promise they could have acted on but didn't by the end of the term counts as contradicted. For a president, PolitiFact's promise-tracker tallies (`promiseTrackers`: the Trump-O-Meter and MAGA-Meter for Donald Trump) count the same way: Promise Kept 1, Compromise ½, Promise Broken 0, with Stalled and In the Works left out | 3 counted checks |
| **Ethics** | 100 − Legal Trouble Index − a tenth of the Insider Trading Index − a tenth of the Stock Disclosure Dodger Index, rounded and never below 0. Legal Trouble: each case's status points (finding 20, open 15, closed 5, allegation 0) × kind (criminal 1.5, ethics or civil 1, technical 0.5) × age (0.5 when decided over 10 years ago), with a ceiling of 100. Insider Trading: committee conflicts, trades near related votes, trades in donors and single-stock activity. Stock Disclosure Dodger: late or missing trade reports and late annual disclosures *(placeholders)* | None: "none located" scores 100% |
| **Workers > Profit** | People-leaning points ÷ (People + Profit points), from votes, sponsorships and cosponsorships on bills marked People or Profit, each at its Rule 1 weight. For a president, signing a marked bill or issuing a marked executive order (keyed `eo-14251`) counts for its side and a veto for the other side. A higher grade means their record works more for lower- and middle-income households | 3 scored actions |

Grades: A 90–100, B 80–89, C 70–79, D 60–69, F below 60, after rounding to a whole percentage. Too little evidence shows "Not graded", never a zero or a guess.

**Not graded:** the ideological position ("More conservative than 48% of the Senate", from Voteview's DW-NOMINATE, Congress only) and the key-vote position ("Conservative side on 4 of 9 marked bills"). The key-vote marking is `liberalSide` / `leanNote` on each issue in `public/research.json`; the logic is in `public/lean.js`.

## Marking and tagging the reviewed research

These judgments are made by people and stored in `public/research.json` (and two small files beside it), never by the refresher:

- **Bills marked People or Profit:** each mark is stored once per bill in `bills` with its side, a short reason and the cited CBO, JCT or Tax Policy Center analysis, so a vote and a sponsorship on the same bill share it: `{"id": "119-hr-1", "pvp": "profit", "why": "...", "src": {"t": "...", "u": "..."}}`. A bill whose analysis shows no clear winner is left unmarked. A tax bill counts as favoring the wealthy when the analysis shows 80% or more of its benefit going to the highest-income households and large corporations *(placeholder)*. Two are marked so far, both Profit: H.R. 1 of 2025, where CBO finds the bottom tenth of households lose about $1,200 a year while the top tenth gain about $13,600 (a loss at the bottom, so the 80% test is not needed), and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, where the Tax Policy Center finds the top 1% get 83% of the benefit by 2027. After adding marks, rerun `node scripts/build-ids.mjs` so the new bills get bill-detail jobs.
- **Bills marked liberal or conservative:** `liberalSide` / `leanNote` on each issue.
- **Promises:** a statement check that is a true commitment carries `"promise": true`; a vague goal ("fight for families") carries `"vague": true` and is listed but not scored; a promise with nothing to act on yet has `"assessment": "pending"`. A promise left unacted at the end of the term is closed as `"assessment": "contradiction"` with `"unacted": {"date": "...", "reason": "..."}`. A changed-position check can carry `"issue"` (an issue ID) so the position-change timing flag can link it to donors' positions on that issue.
- **Ethics cases:** `status` (allegation, investigation or finding) and, for investigations, `stage` (open or closed). When a case changes, its status is updated rather than a new entry added, so it counts once. Leads from court records, FEC enforcement records, DOJ press releases and news become cases only after a reviewer confirms their status from an official record.
- **Stock trades:** reviewed trades go in the person's `trades`: `{"traded": "2026-01-05", "filed": "2026-03-02", "company": "...", "ticker": "...", "sector": "...", "asset": "stock", "type": "purchase", "amount": "$1,001 - $15,000", "owner": "spouse", "src": {"t": "...", "u": "..."}}`, with `"missing": true` for a trade never disclosed and `"flag": "..."` for one flagged for review (not scored). Sectors are those in `public/sectors.js`, assigned from the company's SEC industry code.
- **Committee sectors:** which industries each committee oversees, for committee-conflict trades, in `public/committee-sectors.json` (a draft to review). Committee seats themselves are in `public/committees.json`, written by `scripts/build-ids.mjs`.

Who assigns People/Profit and liberal/conservative marks, and how disagreements are settled, is an open decision in the methodology.

## Update process

The data underneath refreshes daily (see What refreshes). Scores are recalculated once a month, after review, matching the monthly donation data:

1. Review everything new since the last update on **API updates**, **Website updates** and each profile's Latest official records: votes, sponsorships, floor speeches, statements and campaign-site changes, fact-checks, ethics leads (court records, FEC enforcement records, DOJ press releases, news) and case changes, stock-trade disclosures (and `data/holdings-review.json`), donation and lobbying filings.
2. Mark new bills People or Profit from a cited analysis, with the reason.
3. Match new actions to existing promises, and replace earlier statements with votes where Rule 1 applies.
4. Run `npm run scores:monthly` to recalculate Promises delivered, Ethics and Workers > Profit for everyone and rerun the Money & Influence timing flags (`-- --dry-run` previews it).
5. It adds an entry to `public/score-log.json`: which score moved, by how much and why (for example "+1 open investigation"). The Methodology page shows the latest entries, and each grade tab says when it was last recalculated and marks a grade that reviewed edits have changed since.

## Profile tabs

Each profile has six tabs: **Overview**; one tab per grade (**Your match**, **Promises Delivered**, **Ethics**, **Workers > Profit**), each opening with its letter, percentage and arithmetic, then the evidence; and **Money & Influence**. Older links such as `#collins-record` or `#collins-funding` open the tab that now holds that content.

- **Overview:** the four grades (each opens its tab), where the campaign's money comes from (FEC two-year receipts split into small donors, larger individual donors, PACs, party committees, the candidate's own money and a joint-fundraising/other remainder), outside money for and against with the largest spenders named, a per-issue comparison with the viewer's My alignment choices (no evidence is left blank, never scored as a mismatch), where they sit among their chamber's DW-NOMINATE scores, a tally of checked statements that always shows how many were checked, and a short ethics list tagged allegation, investigation or confirmed finding.
- **Your match:** the comparison with the positions you chose, issue by issue, with each action's weight, sorted by the importance you gave; then the record it is drawn from (ideology, key votes, bills, committee assignments with the sectors each committee oversees, state record) and the latest official records.
- **Promises Delivered:** each promise and stated position next to what the record shows, with its credit, "Promise" and "Vague goal" labels, and promises closed at the end of a term; then the latest official records.
- **Ethics:** the grade's three indexes (Legal Trouble 🚨, Insider Trading 📈 and Stock Disclosure Dodger 🙈), then every case, most serious first, with its status, kind and points, and a case timeline. A stock-trading section lists reviewed trades with late or missing disclosures, committee-conflict trades and trades near related votes, and each trading index's parts, with a filing-delay dot chart (days from trade to disclosure, with a line at 45 days), trades by sector (committee-overseen sectors highlighted), and a trade-and-vote timeline with flagged trades. Spouse and dependent-child trades are labeled. Returns are not scored or ranked. State-only officials show "No trading data". New trades, court records, FEC enforcement records and DOJ press releases appear below as leads for review, kept apart from the scored cases.
- **Workers > Profit:** a diverging bar centered at 50%; every scored vote and sponsorship with the bill's mark, reason and source; a tree map of the top 20 donors (People-aligned, Profit-aligned, Other); what their funders wanted next to how they voted; and money and votes by issue.
- **Money & Influence:** the Money & Influence Analysis (below), then where the campaign's money comes from, outside money for and against (also by sector, colored People- or Profit-aligned, with the for-to-against ratio), every PAC contribution and outside-spending item, and the latest official filings.

Every organization named on a profile (PACs, outside spenders, the groups whose positions are collected, and donors' employers) shows a one-line description when its name is hovered, tapped or focused, from `public/orgs.js`: written by hand for the researched groups and a few well-known committees, the researched note where an outside spender has one, and otherwise built from the committee's type, its assigned sector and its stated orientation. The descriptions are context only and never affect a grade.

## Money & Influence Analysis

Shown beside the grades, never inside them. It shows timing and alignment, not proof that money caused a decision. The rules are in `public/influence.js`; the thresholds (top 20 donors, a 50% change, a 6-month window) are placeholders under review.

- **Vote Donor Alignment:** of the votes on bills a group that gave to the campaign took a public position on (its scorecard or key-vote letter, from the reviewed funder research), the share that went the group's way. Missed votes are not counted.
- **Speech Donor Alignment:** not measured yet. Floor speeches arrive from the Congressional Record and need to be coded by issue and side before they can be compared.
- **Donations by month:** each researched group's PAC contributions to the campaign month by month since 2019 (FEC bulk data), with the votes it took a position on marked under its row. From the daily FEC refresh, the top 20 donor organizations in the current cycle combine each organization's PAC with its employees' itemized contributions, grouped by employer (donors' names are never shown), with their employees' giving by month.
- **Timing flags** (for review, not scored), within a 6-month window: donations from a group rose 50% or more from a vote it wanted, compared with the 6 months before; fell 50% or more after a vote it opposed; the person changed position on an issue after a 50% shift in donations from a group that took positions on it; or the person held or traded stock in a group that donated and took positions on bills they acted on. A window that runs past the data is not judged. Each flag lists the group, the amounts before and after, the decision and the dates.
- **Stock holdings and trades** (in the analysis, for review): a "Stock in donors" figure and a section listing reviewed trades in a donor's company, shown as diamonds on that donor's row of the monthly chart; and, from the daily refresh, the latest disclosed trades (not yet reviewed) checked against the top 20 donor organizations, flagged when that organization also lobbied on a bill the person acted on. Trades are covered for members of Congress (Periodic Transaction Reports); a president's OGE Form 278-T reports are not imported yet, and anyone else shows "No trading data". Late filings and committee-conflict trades count in Ethics, not here.
- **Who had a stake:** lobbying reports (LDA.gov) filed for top donor organizations that name a bill the person sponsored, cosponsored or voted on; foreign-agent registrations, comments on federal rules and federal contracts are listed as context.

Outside spending is shown as a plain number, not a grade: the politician cannot legally coordinate with those groups, and the amounts mostly reflect how competitive the race was. Outside spenders have no industry code, so their sector is assigned by this app from each committee's name (unions People-aligned, industry and corporate groups Profit-aligned, party, ideological and candidate-aligned groups Other), the same way PAC sectors are, and is under review.

## Score pages

The **Scores** menu has one page per grade, each ranking every politician, plus the ideological position. Each shows how many data points sit behind every grade, and people who are "Not graded" appear as grey rows rather than being left out. Every chart has a table view. Gauges, pie charts and radar charts are not used.

- **Your match:** ranked bars by match, colored by grade, and an issue-by-issue breakdown for one person, sorted by the importance the visitor chose.
- **Promises delivered:** a stacked bar per politician, in raw counts (supported, partly supported, changed position, contradicted), so a grade built on 3 checks looks different from one built on 20.
- **Ethics:** stacked bars of points lost (Legal Trouble by case status, then the Insider Trading and Stock Disclosure Dodger indexes) for people with deductions, and "X of 59 have no recorded cases".
- **Workers > Profit:** a diverging bar centered at 50%, and Workers > Profit plotted against DW-NOMINATE position to spot outliers.
- **Ideological position:** the whole chamber on the DW-NOMINATE scale, with the selected politician highlighted.

## Home cards

Each card has a **Report Card** (the four grades) and a **Money & Influence Analysis** section: campaign funds raised, outside money for and against, and outside money by month. The monthly chart shows spending for and against side by side, with each month's for-to-against ratio as a line on a scale at the right (all for, 3 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 3, all against). The badge gives the ratio for all seven months, always written for-to-against, such as "2.1 : 1" (green: more for) or "1 : 2.1" (orange: more against), or "No opposing spending" when nothing was spent against them. The rule is `moneyRatio` in `public/grades.js`.

## Portraits

Home cards show a cut-out portrait standing in a party-colored circle; anyone without a photo shows initials in the same circle. Photos are official congressional portraits (public domain) from the [unitedstates/images](https://github.com/unitedstates/images) project, for everyone profiled and every other sitting senator in `public/senate.json`, plus photos supplied for use here, kept in `data/portraits/` and listed with their credit in `scripts/portrait-extra.json` (these take precedence over the official one). `scripts/build-portraits.py` downloads the official photos, removes the background with MediaPipe, scales and places every face the same way, and writes `public/portraits/<id>.webp` plus `public/portraits/index.json` (who has a photo, its source and credit). To rebuild:

```
python3 -m venv .local/pv
.local/pv/bin/pip install mediapipe==0.10.14 pillow
.local/pv/bin/python scripts/build-portraits.py            # add --refresh to download the photos again
.local/pv/bin/python scripts/build-portraits.py --only osborn,alme   # rebuild just those people
```

A newly appointed senator may have no official portrait yet; their card keeps the initials until unitedstates/images adds one (Alan Armstrong and Darline Graham Nordone, as of October 2026). If a cut-out comes out empty, the script retries with MediaPipe's other segmentation model and then the other photo size.

To add or replace a photo, save one you have permission to use as `data/portraits/<id>.jpg`, list it in `scripts/portrait-extra.json` with its credit, and rebuild: `"talarico": {"file": "data/portraits/talarico.jpg", "credit": "Photo: Talarico campaign, used with permission"}`. If a cut-out keeps a light halo from a bright background, add `"tighten": true` and `"choke": 2` to that entry (as for El-Sayed and Jackson) and rebuild. If something wider than the frame, like a hat brim, is cut off on one side, `"nudge": <px>` moves the portrait sideways, and `"zoom": 0.85` shrinks it when it is wider than the whole frame (as for Byrd). A photo that is already a transparent PNG cut-out keeps its own outline.

## Money and votes over time

On the Workers > Profit tab, each funder comparison has a timeline of that organization's money to or about the candidate since January 2019, with the compared votes on the same axis. `public/funder-history.json` holds the month-by-month figures, which the Money & Influence Analysis also uses. Rebuild it with `node scripts/build-funder-history.mjs` (downloads about 90 MB of FEC bulk files into `.local/fec-bulk/`; add `--refresh` to fetch newer files).

## Reviewed research

`public/research.json` contains the original researched snapshot, including biographies, race ratings, Voteview scores, ethics, statements, industry classifications and alignment coding. Edit this file to publish reviewed changes; refresh jobs never rewrite it. Its contents were preserved from the supplied document, not independently fact-checked by this conversion.

`data/config.json` defines who and which election and Congress are tracked, and each person's IDs: Bioguide, LIS, FEC candidate and committee, and (from `scripts/build-ids.mjs`) `ids` (Vote Smart, Wikidata, Ballotpedia and others), `social` (official accounts, plus Bluesky and Threads accounts added by hand), `official` (a sitting member's official website and listed feed), `campaignSite`, `stateLeg` (the state legislature they served in), `inOffice`, and optional `openstates`, `legiscan`, `nicknames` and `federalRegister` set by hand. Coverage is fixed to the supplied 2026 candidate set until reviewed and updated. A featured profile (`featured` in `public/research.json`, today only Donald Trump) gets a card beside the home page's title (its Money & Influence Analysis filled from the daily FEC refresh of the committee that still files, since there is no 2026 race money) and a full profile, but is left out of the home filters and counts, the races, the comparisons and the score pages, which cover the 2026 ballot; the monthly recalculation includes it. Review candidate/committee relationships and election-cycle configuration before moving to a new cycle. `scripts/import-original.mjs` is a one-time extraction tool; rerunning it overwrites the imported frontend/research files.

Job definitions are seeded on the first launch, and jobs for new sources are added to an existing database on the next start. Changing the tracked population or cycle also requires migrating the existing job definitions or starting a new database after backing up `.local/`. Editing research prose does not require a database reset.

## Current status

Before grades go public: review every ethics tag and open/closed label and the liberal/conservative marks, fact-check the original research file, add Workers > Profit bills with cited analyses, tag true campaign promises, and review the committee-sector and outside-spender sector drafts. Also still to do: close promises the person never acted on by the end of their term (the end-of-term rule is built, but no closures are entered yet), and confirm whether Financial Modeling Prep's free plan includes congressional trades. Once your keys are in, check each new source's first live refresh on the Updates screen; the least certain formats are Eulerpool's address and fields, the LDA.gov API host, the Senate committee XML, the FEC enforcement-search fields, the DOJ title filter and the FARA registrant list. A source that answers in an unexpected shape stops with an error on the Updates screen and keeps its last published records. The checklist and the open decisions (deduction values, weights, partial credit, the 80% rule, flag thresholds, who marks bills, state bills, trading deductions) are in [Scores/00_POLITICAL_SCORECARD_METHODOLOGY.md](Scores/00_POLITICAL_SCORECARD_METHODOLOGY.md).

## Checks

Run `npm test` for the refresher (pagination, transaction deduplication, negative corrections, API identity validation, precision-safe IDs, stale-data preservation, atomic publication, never re-fetching a published vote, the bundled seed, refresh locking, request protection, where each key is sent, and new sources joining an existing database), for every new source's adapter, for merging the same trade, state bill or article from several sources (and the official filing winning), for every scoring rule (Rule 1 weights and one credit per bill, statement-only issues at half importance, end-of-term promises, each Ethics deduction and cap, Workers > Profit points, the money ratio), for the Money & Influence measures and flags, for the monthly change log, and for the reviewed data (IDs and committees, ideology marks, Overview inputs, funder timelines, portraits). Run `npm run check` for syntax and import validation, and `python3 scripts/build-holdings.py --self-test` for the holdings parser.

Each source's adapter is covered by representative response tests built from that source's documentation: Congress.gov and GovInfo from their official documentation repositories, Bargo from its published OpenAPI description, and the rest from their documentation pages. **No live response has been checked**: authenticated refreshes need your keys, and this project was built where those hosts were not reachable. A few formats come from third-party descriptions and are the most likely to need adjusting once live: Eulerpool's congress-trading path and fields, the LDA.gov API host, the Senate's committee-membership XML, the FEC legal-search fields, the DOJ press-release title filter and the FARA registrant list. An adapter that gets an unexpected response stops with an error on the Updates screen and keeps the last published records; nothing wrong is published.

The Worker bundle builds locally (`node scripts/build.mjs`). Cloudflare runtime/deployment verification remains a later step; no cloud deployment has been performed.

## Deploy later to Cloudflare

The local and Cloudflare servers share the same refresh and API implementation. There is no separate frontend build.

1. `npx wrangler login`
2. `npx wrangler d1 create public-ledger`
3. Put the returned database ID in `wrangler.jsonc`.
4. `npm run db:migrate`
5. `npx wrangler secret put FEC_API_KEY`, then the same for `CONGRESS_API_KEY`, `GOVINFO_API_KEY`, `VOTESMART_API_KEY`, `OPENSTATES_API_KEY`, `LEGISCAN_API_KEY`, `LDA_API_KEY`, `BARGO_API_KEY`, `EULERPOOL_API_KEY`, `FMP_API_KEY`, `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `NYT_API_KEY`, `REGULATIONS_API_KEY`, `SAM_API_KEY` and `SEC_USER_AGENT` (skip any you don't use)
6. `npm run cloudflare:deploy`

The hosted cron checks every five minutes, processing up to eight source pages per invocation. With every source enabled there are about 1,000 jobs plus one per new Congressional Record issue, so the first full refresh takes most of a day. Use the Workers paid plan for the configured CPU allowance. D1 and Worker usage may incur charges beyond included allowances; this project does not enable billing or create any cloud resources by itself. The hosted database begins empty and fills from official sources; the reviewed snapshot is bundled with the static assets. Local SQLite files and API keys are excluded from deployment.

Deployment remains a later manual step because this version was requested to stay local.

## Choices behind this design

- **Every source that can run alongside the others is used.** Using several services for the same data adds merging work but gives cross-checks and keeps data flowing if one service changes its free tier or shuts down, as Lambda Finance did.
- **State records: Open States and LegiScan together,** merged by state bill number. LegiScan is checked weekly, which keeps it well inside its monthly query cap.
- **Speeches: the GovInfo API directly.** The refresher runs in JavaScript, so the `crec` Python package isn't needed.
- **Committee documents and testimony through Congress.gov's committee-meeting endpoint,** which serves the House Document Repository's files with structured witness data, rather than reading the repository's pages.
- **Stock trades: the official House and Senate reports, read directly,** with Bargo, Eulerpool and Financial Modeling Prep as a cross-check. Duplicate trades are merged, disagreements go to review, and lateness uses the official report's filing date. Capitol API is not used: it reads the same official filings.
- **Senate votes use LIS IDs** from congress-legislators, replacing surname-and-state matching.
- **Donor names stay hidden:** FEC rules restrict reusing individual contributors' information, so donors are grouped by employer and names are never kept.
- **House votes from Congress.gov** for 2023 on when its key is set, since it now serves them officially; the House Clerk's files remain for older votes and as the fallback.
- **Stock-trade history:** the refresh reads both chambers' official trade reports from the last two years. Older trades and yearly holdings come from `scripts/build-holdings.py`, checked by hand.
- **Court records weekly, profiled people only:** CourtListener's free account allows about 125 requests a day.
- **News from GDELT and the New York Times together,** merged by link.
- **Grades are computed from the reviewed research and logged monthly.** The page always reflects the reviewed file, and marks any grade that differs from the last monthly recalculation, so nothing changes silently between runs.
- **Left out because they repeat work already done, not because of a key:** the `crec` package (the GovInfo API is used directly) and Capitol API (CapitolGains reads the same filings). Sources that are shut down, closing or paid are listed in [.01_API_SOURCES_USED.md](.01_API_SOURCES_USED.md).

# Public Ledger
### Follow the money. Check the record. Find your alignment.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa265870-665c-41b5-8ec7-2bce1c1c7391" />

Public Ledger helps voters understand **who funds their elected officials, how they vote, and whether their actions match their promises**.

The platform brings complex public records into one easy-to-read **candidate scorecard**, helping users explore:

- **Campaign Funding:** Who financially supports a candidate and how funding patterns relate to their legislative record.
- **Legislative Record:** Bills introduced, sponsored, and voted on, with plain-language summaries of their purpose and potential effects.
- **Promises vs. Actions:** How campaign promises and public statements compare with documented actions.
- **Ethics & Accountability:** Documented ethics history, clearly distinguishing ongoing investigations from confirmed violations.
- **Funder–Legislation Connections:** Compare funders’ public positions on bills with the actions of politicians they support, highlighting shared interests and potential influence without assuming causation.
- **Voter Alignment:** How candidates’ records and stated positions align with users’ policy priorities.

Our goal is to **make political accountability accessible** through clear, source-backed information that helps voters make informed choices.
