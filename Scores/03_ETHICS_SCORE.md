## Index designs

### Legal Trouble Index 🚨
**Measures:** how serious their legal and ethics cases are, from official records.

Each case is worth its **status points × kind of case × age**:

- **Status points:**
  - Confirmed finding: 20 (a conviction, guilty plea, ethics committee finding, agency penalty, or the person admitting it).
  - Open investigation: 15 (an indictment not yet resolved, an active probe or a pending lawsuit).
  - Closed without a finding: 5 (acquittal, dismissal, no charges, or a settlement without admitting anything).
  - Allegation: 0. Listed, but no official body acted on it.
- **Kind of case:**
  - Criminal: × 1.5 (indictments, convictions, guilty pleas).
  - Ethics or civil: × 1 (House or Senate Ethics, agency enforcement, civil lawsuits).
  - Technical: × 0.5 (FEC fines for late reports, disclosure mistakes that were corrected).
- **Age:** × 0.5 if the case's latest status change was more than 10 years ago. Open cases always count in full.

The index is the total of every case's points, with a ceiling of 100.

| Status | Criminal | Ethics or civil | Technical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Confirmed finding | 30 | 20 | 10 |
| Open investigation | 22.5 | 15 | 7.5 |
| Closed without a finding | 7.5 | 5 | 2.5 |

**Rules:**
- **Each case counts once, at its current status.** When an indictment ends in a conviction, the entry is updated, not added again.
- **One matter is one case.** If the same conduct leads to both a DOJ case and an ethics probe, only the more serious one counts.
- **Leads don't count.** Court records, DOJ press releases and FEC enforcement records from the daily refresh count only after their status is confirmed from an official record.
- **No cases** scores 0, shown as "No recorded cases".

**Example:** an open criminal investigation (15 × 1.5 = 22.5), an ethics finding from 12 years ago (20 × 1 × 0.5 = 10) and a closed FEC late-filing case (5 × 0.5 = 2.5) give 22.5 + 10 + 2.5 = **35**.

**Keys and sources:**
- **The cases themselves:** the reviewed research. No key.
- **New leads to review:**
  - `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN`: court records.
  - `FEC_API_KEY` <img src="../assets/checkbox-checked.svg" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="Done">: FEC enforcement records.
  - DOJ press releases: no key.

### Insider Trading Index 📈
**Measures:** stock trades that overlap with the person's power, donors or votes.

- **Committee conflicts (40%, required):** the dollar value of trades in single companies' stock, in sectors their committees oversee, ÷ the dollar value of all their single-company trades. Each trade's dollar value is the middle of its disclosed range. For example, "$1,001–$15,000" counts as $8,000.
- **Trades near related votes (25%):** the share of trades made within 30 days before or after a vote or bill action of theirs that affects that company's sector.
- **Trades in donors (20%):** the share of trades in a company whose PAC or employees gave to them, or that lobbied on a bill they acted on.
- **Single-stock activity (15%):** single-company trades per year, with a ceiling of 50 trades a year. Funds, ETFs and bonds don't count.

**Rules:**
- Spouse and dependent-child trades count and are labeled.
- Fewer than 5 reviewed trades means "Not enough data", with the raw flags still listed.
- No trades at all scores 0, shown as "No trades".
- People not in Congress show "No trading data". A president shows "Not scored for a president", with the trades listed.
- Trades that made unusually good returns are shown as leads only, never scored.

**Also shown on:** the Money & Influence tab, beside the trade list. It's the same number, not a second score.

**Example:** conflicts 30, near votes 20, donors 10, activity 24 gives (0.4×30) + (0.25×20) + (0.2×10) + (0.15×24) = **23**.

**Keys and sources:**
- **Trades:**
  - The members' own trade reports, from the House Clerk and Senate eFD: no key.
  - Cross-checks: `BARGO_API_KEY`, `EULERPOOL_API_KEY` and `FMP_API_KEY`, all optional.
  - Not used: `DISCLOSED_CAPITOL_API_KEY`. Its free credits are a one-time trial.
  - The president's trades: Disclosed Capitol's open dataset of the OGE reports, no key (`npm run exec:build`).
- **Company sectors:** `SEC_USER_AGENT`, your name and email (not a key).
- **Committees and the sectors they oversee:** congress-legislators and the Senate and House committee lists. No key.
- **Votes and bill actions:**
  - Senate and House roll calls: no key.
  - `CONGRESS_API_KEY`: bill actions and House votes from 2023 on.
- **Donors:** `FEC_API_KEY` <img src="../assets/checkbox-checked.svg" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="Done"> for PAC money and donors by employer.
- **Lobbying:** `LDA_API_KEY` (optional).

### Stock Disclosure Dodger Index 🙈
**Measures:** stock and holdings reports that were filed late or never filed.

- **Late or missing trade reports (70%, required):** the share of trades reported after the 45-day deadline, or never reported.
- **Late annual financial disclosures (30%):** the share of the last 3 years' annual reports filed after the deadline, extensions included. These are the yearly reports that list holdings, including stocks. They come from the House disclosure index.

**Rules:**
- **Minimum:** at least 3 required filings.
- **People not in Congress:** "No trading data."
- **Late FEC campaign reports:** not part of this index, because they're campaign money, not stock. An FEC fine for late reports counts in the Legal Trouble Index 🚨 as a technical case once it's reviewed.

Late trade reports are counted here, not in the Insider Trading Index, so nothing is counted twice.

**Keys and sources:**
- **Trade and filing dates:** the members' own trade reports, from the House Clerk and Senate eFD (no key). The trade services above are optional cross-checks.
- **Annual disclosures:** the House disclosure index. No key.
- **Senators:** their trade reports are read from Senate eFD, but their annual disclosures aren't imported yet. For senators, the annual-disclosure part drops out and only the trade-report part counts.

### New Ethics grade formula ⚖️
**Ethics** = 100 − Legal Trouble Index − (Insider Trading Index × 0.10) − (Stock Disclosure Dodger Index × 0.10). It never goes below 0.

- **Cases count in full.** They're the main part of the grade, and serious enough cases alone can bring it to 0.
- **Trading can cost at most 20 points,** the same as today. The deduction now reflects how serious the trading is, not just how many bad trades there were.

**Example:** Legal Trouble Index 35, Insider Trading Index 23 and Stock Disclosure Dodger Index 40 give 100 − 35 − 2.3 − 4 = **58.7, rounded to 59 (F)**.

The three indexes don't overlap:
- **Legal Trouble Index 🚨:** official findings, investigations and charges.
- **Insider Trading Index 📈:** what they traded, and whether it overlaps with their committees, votes or donors.
- **Stock Disclosure Dodger Index 🙈:** whether they reported it on time.
